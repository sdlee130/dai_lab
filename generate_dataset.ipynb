      "{'text': \" I've always been fascinated by insects, but ants have held a special place in my heart since I was young. My grandmother used to tell me stories about them while we tended her garden together. She would point out different species and explain how they worked as a collective unit - all thanks to those magical chemicals called pheromones.\\n\\nOne summer day, armed with my trusty magnifying glass (for close observation only!) and notebook, I decided to conduct an experiment inspired by Grandma's tales. I placed a piece of chocolate on one side of our yard, hoping to observe firsthand how these tiny creatures communicated using trail pheromones. It wasn't long before an adventurous ant found the treat and began laying down a scent trail back to the nest. Soon enough, a line of ants marched towards the chocolate, creating what looked like a miniature highway of industry.\\n\\nAs I watched, engrossed in their organized chaos, I noticed something peculiar happening at the edge of the yard – another group of ants had discovered a picnic blanket left unattended after lunch. They too started forming a trail leading to the abandoned feast. However, instead of merging with my original ant superhighway, they seemed determined to create their own path, despite crossing mine multiple times.\\n\\nThis is where things took an unexpected turn. Instead of simply ignoring each other's trails, both groups doubled down on their efforts! More ants joined in, reinforcing the existing trails until the air became thick with competing scents. What followed resembled more of a battlefield than two harmonious colonies working together. A war waged between rival factions over crumbs and cookie bits.\\n\\nConfused and slightly guilty (who knew ants could experience such animosity?), I realized there might not be a peaceful resolution. That evening, under the cover of darkness, I removed any evidence of human indulgence from the scene, leaving behind two exhausted armies without a cause.\\n\\nReflecting on this comical skirmish, I gained newfound appreciation for just how complex even small parts of nature can be. Even though ants rely heavily on chemical communication, external factors and competition still play significant roles in shaping their behavior. Just because they follow set patterns doesn't mean they don't face challenges or conflicts within their society. And sometimes, even with clear instructions laid out, misunderstandings happen.\\n\\nIn essence, ants aren't so different from us humans; we too navigate our world through various forms of communication, encounter disagreements, and make mistakes along the way. Our lives may seem vastly different due to scale and complexity, but maybe, just maybe, if we pay attention, we might learn something about ourselves from these minuscule messengers.\", 'prompt': 'Write a real-life story shared by someone in a reddit forum. The story should be somehow related to this text snippet: \\n“What are some ways that ants use pheromones to communicate with each other?\\n1. Trail pheromones: Ants use trail pheromones to mark a path to a food source or a new nesting site. By following the pheromone trail, other ants can quickly locate the same resource.\\n\\n2. Alarm pheromones: When an ant detects danger, it releases alarm pheromones that alert other ants in the colony. These pheromones help the other ants to locate the source of the danger and respond accordingly.\\n\\n3. Recruitment pheromones: Ants use recruitment pheromones to help the colony coordinate its efforts when foraging for food. Scouts will locate a food source and then return to the nest to lay a trail of recruitment pheromones, which encourage other ants to join in the search for food.\\n\\n4. Sex pheromones: Ants use sex pheromones to locate and attract mates. The queen ant releases pheromones to attract males during mating season, and individual ants also release sex pheromones to signal their availability for mating.\\n\\n5.”\\n\\nThe story should include: \\n- Niche interests or humor: dive into specific hobbies, interests, or humorous situations \\n- An unexpected plot twist or engaging conflict: introduce a relatable yet challenging situation or dilemma that the author faced. \\n- Reflection and insight: end with a resolution that offers a new understanding, a sense of community, or a personal revelation, much like the conclusions drawn in forum discussions.\\nStart the story right away.', 'text_token_length': 592, 'seed_data': 'ultrachat', 'format': 'story_reddit', 'audience': 'general'}\n"

Be concise and precise with both the question and the question type selection.\\n    \\n    ### Example:\\n    Context: \\n     Back when I was working on Senator Thompson's reelection campaign in 2018, we were all about embracing digital technologies to connect with our constituents and stay competitive. We had a solid social media presence across multiple platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, where we shared everything from policy proposals to town hall meeting recaps. Our team believed that being active digitally would help us engage better with potential voters and strengthen our support base. And boy, did it ever!\\n\\nOur campaign volunteer coordinator, Jamie, came up with an innovative idea - she suggested hosting live Q&A sessions via Instagram Stories, allowing followers to ask questions directly to the senator. It turned out to be a game changer; not only did it boost engagement metrics but also helped build trust among younger demographics who appreciated having direct access to the candidate. This strategy paid off handsomely during early voting, giving us a comfortable lead over our opponents.\\n\\nAnother area where technology played a crucial role was online fundraising. Gone were the days of knocking door-to-door or making countless phone calls asking for contributions. Instead, we focused on creating user-friendly donation forms integrated into our website and promoted them through emails and social media posts. Watching those numbers climb every day became both exhilarating and nerve-wracking at the same time. But then again, isn't politics always a rollercoaster ride?\\n\\nHowever, there was one aspect of digital campaigning no one could prepare us for – the dark side of social media. A few weeks before Election Day, someone hacked into our official Twitter account and started posting offensive content that didn't align with our values or message. Panic ensued within our team, knowing how much damage this could cause to our reputation and chances of winning.\\n\\nIn what felt like hours but must have been mere minutes, we managed to regain control of the account and delete the malicious tweets. However, screenshots had already spread far beyond our ability to contain them. That night, instead of celebrating another successful day on the campaign trail, we huddled together, brainstorming crisis management strategies while fielding angry messages from supporters demanding answers.\\n\\nDespite our best efforts, the incident left a sour taste amongst some undecided voters, causing a slight dip in polling numbers. Yet, something surprising happened afterwards – many more people rallied behind us, expressing sympathy and outrage over the attack. Their vocal support reminded us why we got involved in politics in the first place: to make a difference, even if it meant facing challenges along the way.\\n\\nSo yes, digital technologies transformed political party campaigns and outreach in unforeseen ways, offering opportunities for deeper connections yet exposing vulnerabilities never imagined before. Looking back, I wouldn't change a thing because ultimately, it taught us valuable lessons about resilience, adaptability, and community spirit.\\n    \\n    ---\\n    \\n    Question: \\n    [Write a detailed and specific question based on the context]\\n    \\n    Question Type: \\n    [Select one from the list above, matching the question generated]\\n\\n     [/INST] Question: What kind of direct access to the candidate did campaign volunteer coordinator Jamie introduce through digital technologies?\\nQuestion Type: Individual\\n\\nQuestion: How did the team manage the situation when their official Twitter account was hacked and started posting offensive content?\\nQuestion Type: Lasting time of something</s>\""
